  <h2>CSS</h2>
  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language that describes how the markup language is actually displayed [1], used primarily in HTML and XHTML, and is also available in XML. It is the standard of W3C and has a high degree of freedom in defining layouts and styles.
  The default file name [2] is style.css.
  If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for the body of the website, the CSS is responsible for decorating clothes and accessories. In other words, if you leave the HTML structure intact and change the CSS file, you can decorate it like a completely different website.
  In the case of CSS3, currently under development, features have been added to replace images produced by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradations, and variations. In addition, various animation features have been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.
